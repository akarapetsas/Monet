# Monet
Monet is a wrapper of the Volley and the Jackson libraries. Itâ€™s 
offering a L1 memory caching by using the LRU Cache, apart from 
the L2 disk caching that Volley offers through the HTTP headers 
"Cache-Control" and "Expires". You can see the library in action 
by running the sample app.

Features to be added soon:

1. Support of Gson library.
2. Configurable L1 disk cache.
